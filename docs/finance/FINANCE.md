# Finance module: working reference

What is actually built and how it behaves, kept current as sessions land. The intent and the full data
model are in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md); how to build it is in [README.md](README.md). If this file and
`DESIGN.md` disagree about what exists, this file is right and the design is the plan.

**Public repository: no names, account numbers, UPI IDs, salaries or amounts here.** Roles only.

## Status

| Session | State |
|---|---|
| 01 Foundation & access | Built on branch `finance-01-foundation` (draft PR). Migration `0077` **applied to TVC ERP on 2026-11-02**. |
| 02-13 | Not started |

## Access

Two modules in the staff registry (`netlify/functions/lib/staff-registry.ts`), granted on the Access screen
like any other, per person. A super admin has no implicit finance access.

| Module | Role | Capabilities |
|---|---|---|
| `finance` | `admin` (directors) | all ten |
| `finance` | `user` (finance operators) | `view`, `import`, `allocate`, `request` |
| `finance` | `read_only` (viewers, auditors) | `view` |
| `finance-requests` | `user` / `admin` | `raise`, `add-vendor`, `scan-bill`, `payroll-input` |

`finance` capabilities: `view`, `import`, `allocate`, `request`, `approve`, `approve-payroll`,
`verify-payee`, `close-period`, `configure`, `export`. The last six are admin-only.

- `finance-requests` is a separate module on purpose: `requireStaff(req, 'finance', ...)` looks up the role in
  `finance` only, so holding `finance-requests` opens nothing in the ledger. (Tested.)
- **Auditors** are `read_only` grants with an end date. The Access screen shows "Ends 3 Dec 2026" beside a
  read-only role; the date is the last day, to the close of that day in India time, at most 13 months ahead.
  Only `read_only` can carry one. An expired grant is refused with the same 403 as no grant, is hidden from the
  person's tool list, and is checked on every request (not cached). Setting or clearing it is audited.
- **Auditor visits are logged.** Opening the overview as `read_only` writes `finance.overview_viewed` to
  `fin_audit_log`; if the log cannot be written the page is refused.
- **Masking.** `payeeFieldVisibility(capabilities)` in `scripts/lib/finance-access.mjs`: names are visible to
  anyone with `view`; payee account numbers and UPI IDs only to holders of `verify-payee` or `export`.
  `maskAccountNumber` ("•••• 0123") and `maskUpiId` ("p••••@bank") are there for the screens that need a masked form.
  No payee data exists yet; later sessions apply these in their responses.
- **Maker is not checker.** `makerIsNotChecker(...personIds)` returns true only if every person is known and all
  differ. Later sessions call it server-side for payment approval and payroll (preparer, confirmer, checker).

## Tables (migration `0077_finance_foundation.sql`)

`fin_entities`, `fin_bank_accounts` (last four digits only), `fin_categories` (the type sits on the category),
`fin_periods` (one row per month, open or closed), `fin_audit_log` (append-only by trigger). All RLS-on with no
policies and `anon`/`authenticated` revoked: only the Netlify Functions, using the service role, can touch them.
Seeded: one entity and a **draft** category list (23 generic heads) for the directors to confirm.
Also adds `staff_module_roles.expires_at`.

## Endpoints and pages

- `GET /api/finance-admin/overview` (needs `finance` / `view`): entity name, your role and capabilities, what
  you may see unmasked, counts of accounts, categories and open months, `hasData: false`.
- `/internal/finance/`: shows "No data yet", the counts and your access.
- `/internal/finance-requests/`: a placeholder so a granted person's tile leads somewhere.

## Tests

`node --test scripts/lib/finance-access.test.mjs scripts/lib/finance-endpoint.test.mjs` (also run by the
`Finance tests` GitHub Action). The first covers expiry, the capability matrix, masking and maker-is-not-checker;
the second drives the real function through `requireStaff` with Google and Supabase stubbed (needs `npm ci`
for esbuild, and Node 22.18+ or newer, which imports the registry `.ts` directly).

## Migration 0077

Applied to TVC ERP on 2026-11-02 (recorded as `finance_foundation`). Checked afterwards: 1 entity, 23 categories,
RLS on for all five `fin_*` tables, no `anon`/`authenticated` grants, `expires_at` present and null on every
existing grant. `requireStaff` selects `expires_at`, so the column has to exist before this code is deployed.
